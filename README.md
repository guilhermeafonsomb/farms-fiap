# Farms FIAP App

This repository contains the Farms FIAP mobile application built with Expo and Firebase. The app allows users to manage farm-related data with a seamless offline-first experience, leveraging Firebase services and local emulators for development.

---

## Project Overview

Farms FIAP is a cross-platform mobile app built using Expo and Firebase. It uses Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions to provide a robust backend. For local development, Firebase emulators are used to simulate backend services, enabling faster iteration and offline testing.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or newer (for Android builds)
- Android Studio (for Android emulator)
- Xcode (for iOS simulator, macOS only)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/farms-fiap.git
cd farms-fiap
```

### 2. Install dependencies for the Expo app

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Install dependencies for Firebase Functions

Navigate to the functions directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd functions
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
npm run build
```

Return to the root directory when done:

```bash
cd ..
```

## Firebase Emulators Setup with Seed Data

The project uses Firebase emulators for Authentication, Firestore, and Functions to run locally.

### 1. Start Firebase Emulators

Run the following command from the project root:

```bash
npm run emulators:start
```

### 2. Seeded Test User Credentials

You can use the following test user to log in during development:

- **Email:** teste@fiap.com
- **Password:** 123456!

---

## Running the App

### iOS

1. Start the Firebase emulators as described above.
2. In a new terminal, start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

3. Press `i` to open the iOS simulator or scan the QR code with Expo Go on your iOS device.

### Android

1. Start the Firebase emulators.
2. Start the Expo development server.
3. Press `a` to open the Android emulator or scan the QR code with Expo Go on your Android device.

---

## Firebase Configuration Details

### 1. GoogleService Files

- **iOS:** Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in the `ios/` directory.
- **Android:** Place `google-services.json` in the `android/app/` directory.

These files are required for Firebase SDK initialization on each platform.

### 2. Android Gradle Plugins

Ensure the following plugins are added in your `android/build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
        classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.9.5'
    }
}
```

And apply the plugins in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
```

### 3. Android Keystore

For signing your Android app, configure your keystore as follows:

- Place your keystore file (e.g., `my-release-key.keystore`) in the `android/app/` directory.
- Update `android/gradle.properties` with your keystore credentials:

```properties
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=your-store-password
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=your-key-password
```

## How the App Connects to Firebase Emulators

The app dynamically detects the environment and connects to the Firebase emulators when running locally. This is configured in the appâ€™s Firebase initialization code:

- Authentication emulator on `localhost:9099`
- Firestore emulator on `localhost:8080`
- Functions emulator on `localhost:5001`

When running in production, the app connects to the live Firebase services.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Emulator connection issues:** Ensure the Firebase emulators are running before starting the app.
- **Port conflicts:** Confirm ports 9099, 8080, and 5001 are free.
- **Android build errors:** Verify JDK version and Android Studio installation.
- **iOS build errors:** Ensure Xcode command line tools are installed and updated.
- **Expo issues:** Clear cache with `expo start -c`.
